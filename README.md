# Description
My personal blog, mainly used for notes.

> Keep reading, writing, thinking. 

This blog is powered by [docsify](docsify.js.org).
## Some Notes
1. Math is supported by the plugin docsify-katex:
    * the plugin script should be placed after the docsify script.
    * table should be preceded by a newline
2. Added `_sidebar.md` in each subdirectory
3. Begin with level-2 header (the level-2 header is auto inserted using sidebar )
